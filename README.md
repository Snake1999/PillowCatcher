# PillowCatcher
A simple USB Power Delivery decoyer, that decoy and gets different voltages from USB Type-C PD chargers.
## What's this?
With powerful USB-IF and new USB Type-C connectors, USB PD now has an ability to deliver 60-W power, which is arranged in different U-I configurations, such as 20V-3A and 5V-3A. What this device does is to communicate with the charger, do the CC-Logic, and "decoy" different voltages out for charging or experimental uses.
This repo contains hardware and software docs. Enjoy! :D
## Is PillowCatcher ready?
Not yet. This device is still in early design on draft papers. Experimental circuits will be designed soon. :D
## Can I use code or designs here for my designs?
Yes you can. This project is under MIT which allows you to do this. :D
